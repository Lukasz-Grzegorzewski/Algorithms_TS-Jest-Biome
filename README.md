# ðŸ“š Algorithm Practice Repository

> This repository contains a collection of algorithmic problems implemented in **TypeScript**. The algorithms focus on data structures like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, and more. Problems are sourced from platforms such as **LeetCode** and similar.

> The goal of this repository is to improve **problem-solving skills** through algorithm practice and help prepare for technical interviews. All algorithms are accompanied by unit tests to verify correctness.

> If you are here to **practice**, it's recommended that you **erase the given solutions** and attempt to solve the problem on your own. If you're completely blocked or stuck, feel free to take a look at the solution for guidance.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms-practice.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd algorithms-practice

# Install the dependencies
npm i
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lukasz-Grzegorzewski/Algorithms_TS-Jest-Biome.git
cd algorithms-practice
npm i
```

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests with Jest

> This repository uses Jest for unit testing. You can run all tests across different categories or focus on specific types of problems such as arrays, strings, linked lists, or trees. Test cases are provided alongside the algorithms for thorough validation.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for specific categories (check package.json for scripts)
npm run test_leetcode_easy_arrays   # Example for testing array algorithms
```

## âœ¨ Biome Code Formatting

> This project uses Biome as the default code formatter to ensure consistent code style throughout the repository.
> Biome helps enforce coding standards and style across the repository.

Setting up Biome:
* Install the Biome plugin in your code editor (for example, VSCode).
* Set Biome as the default formatter in your editor.

## ðŸ’¡ Contributing

> Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new algorithms, optimize existing ones, or improve the documentation, feel free to open a pull request.

> When adding a new algorithm, it is **essential** to include the appropriate **unit tests** to validate your solution. Each algorithm should be accompanied by tests to ensure correctness and to maintain the quality of the repository.

> To contribute:

* $\color{lightgreen}{Fork}$ the repository
* $\color{lightgreen}{Create}$ a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm`)
* $\color{lightgreen}{Implement}$ your changes
* $\color{lightgreen}{Add unit tests}$ for the new algorithm or changes
* $\color{lightgreen}{Add a script}$ into package.json if necessary (for a new category of algorithms)
* $\color{lightgreen}{Run tests}$ (`npm test`) to ensure everything works correctly
* $\color{lightgreen}{Submit}$ a pull request
