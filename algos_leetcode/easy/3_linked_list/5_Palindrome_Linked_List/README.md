  Palindrome Linked List

  Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

# Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1,null]              1-> 2-> 2-> 1-> null
Output: true

# Example 2: 
Input: head = [1,2,null],                   1-> 2-> null
Output: false

# Constraints:
  - The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
  - 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
