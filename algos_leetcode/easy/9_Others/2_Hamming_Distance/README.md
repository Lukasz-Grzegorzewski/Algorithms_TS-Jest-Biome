  Hamming Distance

  The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

  Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

# Example 1:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

# Example 2:
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1

# constraints:
  - 0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1

# Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
